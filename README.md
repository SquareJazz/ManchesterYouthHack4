## The Challenge

Make us laugh!
Do something silly with a Raspberry Pi, Microbit, Makey Makey and any other bits and pieces.

It could look or act funny, doing something unexpected when you come near it, talk to it or push its buttons, prank us...

Use your imagination.

And remember that pranks and jokes are supposed to make people good, not feel embarrassed or uncomfortable - so do something you'd be happy to be on the receiving end of.

And most importantly, have fun!
