## The Challenge

The reason developers work so well together is that we all believe that the most important question is 'why?' When you have a purpose and are all driven towards the same goals, everyone pulls in the same direction, and you become hugely effective as a team.

Our 'why' is simple: to have a positive impact.

We challenge you to channel that way of thinking and build a hack that will have a positive impact. This could be on an individual, a business, your local community: anything!

## The Prize
